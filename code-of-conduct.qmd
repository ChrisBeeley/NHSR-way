# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

Accordingly, everyone who participates in the NHS-R Community and the NHS-R Community Way project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

Zoë Turner, as lead instigator in this community, and all project members, are dedicated to a ***harassment-free experience for everyone***, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or class. **We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form**.

We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

# Introduction {#sec-conduct}

The NHS-R Community Way is a community-oriented and -led project, although supported through the NHS it is not exclusively open to just NHS employees and, as such, we have members from other public sector organisations, academia, charities, the voluntary sector as well as individuals who have an interest in healthcare data and data science.
We value the involvement of everyone in the community.
We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing.
All participants in our in-person events and online communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others at all times.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in activities associated with the NHS-R Community and the NHS-R Community Way project is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NHS-R Community including, but not limited to, in-person meetings, conferences, workshops, and communications online via GitHub and the NHS-R Community Slack.

The NHS-R Community has a core development team which consists of:

* [Zoë Turner](mailto:zoe.turner3@nhs.net) - who is also the lead investigator of the NHS-R Community Way and is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct
* [Chris Beeley](mailto:chris1.beeley@nhs.net) - who leads the NHS-R Community

The central email [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net) is accessed by Chris Beeley, Zoë Turner and administrative/support staff in the Strategy Unit.

Both Chris Beeley and Zoë Turner are employees of NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Strategy Unit and are not excluded from this Code of Conduct but, if required, contact can be made with the Senior Management team within the Strategy Unit in the same organisation through [strategy.unit@nhs.net](mailto:strategy.unit@nhs.net) which neither have access to.

The NHS-R Community Way team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.
We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, class or experience level.

Everyone who participates in the NHS-R Community activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NHS-R Community including, but not limited to, in person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub and the NHS-R Slack group.
By participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the NHS-R Community resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information as well as sharing of that information with organisations.

## Expected Behaviour

We are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications.
The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:

* **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
* **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.
* **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.
* **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs or screen shares of others without their permission. Do not share other participant’s personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent ("doxing") is a form of harassment.
* **Be considerate of others’ participation**. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.
* **Don’t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.
* As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes**.

All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.
See [this explanation of the four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) - no feigning surprise, no well-actuallys, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by the NHS-R community members at any project event or platform include:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
* violent threats or language directed against another person
* the display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* insults or put downs
* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
* excessive swearing
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
* publication of private communication without consent

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
This applies to all NHS-R Community events and platforms, either online or in-person.
If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund if a cost has been incurred), or impose any other appropriate sanctions (see the [enforcement manual](#4-enforcement-manual) for details).

It may be that behaviour deemed unacceptable within the NHS-R Community does not necessarily correspond to regulations or policies from hosting organisations to an event or to the organisation (where applicable) that a person is representing. Under these circumstances we expect that any missing behaviours from either organisation or group are respected but that the NHS-R Community Code of Conduct is adhered to and amended to include any missing behaviours as soon as possible. 

## Feedback

This Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which everyone must abide.
Rather, you are invited to make suggestions for updates or clarifications by contacting Zoë Turner at [zoe.turner3@nhs.net](mailto:zoe.turner3@nhs.net) or by making a pull request to this document on GitHub.

# Incident Reporting Guidelines

## Contact points

If you feel able to, please contact Zoë Turner by email at [zoe.turner3@nhs.net](mailto:zoe.turner3@nhs.net).

## Alternate contact points

If you do not feel comfortable contacting Zoë Turner, please report an incident to Chris Beeley by email at [chris.beeley1@nhs.net](mailto:chris.beeley1@nhs.net).

If you do not feel comfortable contacting either Zoë Turner or Chris Beeley, you may wish to contact the Senior Management team within the Strategy Unit (NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Strategy Unit) through [strategy.unit@nhs.net](mailto:strategy.unit@nhs.net) which neither have access to.

## What to do if someone is in physical danger

If you believe someone is in physical danger, please contact the appropriate emergency responders.

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

A detailed enforcement policy is available in the Enforcement Manual below.

# Enforcement Manual

This enforcement manual is used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.
Enforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.

## The Code of Conduct Committee

The Code of Conduct committee is:

* Chris Beeley: chris.beeley1@nhs.net
* Zoë Turner: zoe.turner3@nhs.net

We will always seek to build a larger committee including members outside of the core development team.

## Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally

If the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member.
This can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the NHS-R Community.

If the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation.
In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a physical space.

In situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally, they must inform [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net) as a central point of contact as soon as possible, and report their actions for review within 24 hours.

It is likely that a situation at this level will require incidents being raised in the NHS Midlands and Lancashire Commissioning Strategy Unit as well as any other corresponding organisations. Please ensure that you comply with local incident reporting systems and share incident reference numbers with [nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net](mailto:nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net).

## Less-Urgent Situations

Upon receiving a report of an incident, the Code of Conduct committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- whether this is an ongoing situation
- whether there is a threat to anyone's physical safety
- what happened
- whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
- who, if anyone, was the bad actor
- what action, if any, needs to be taken with organisations

This information will be collected either in person or in writing.
The Code of Conduct committee will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident.
All participants will be anonymised in the summary report, referred to as "Community Member 1", "Community Member 2", or "Research Team Member 1".
The "de-anonymising key" will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated reports against the same person over time.

The Code of Conduct committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within 5 working days.
In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

## Resolutions

The Code of Conduct committee will seek to agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question.
If the committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, Zoë Turner, as lead investigator of the NHS-R Community Way project, will break the tie.
If Zoë Turner is unable to take part in the discussion due to a conflict of interest, Chris Beeley, as a second member of the Code of Conduct committee, will make the decision.

Possible responses may include:

* A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.
* A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.
* A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.
* Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct.
* A private in-person conversation between a member of the team and the individual(s) involved.
  In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.
* A private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the individual(s) involved.
  In this case, the research team member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing nhs.rcommunity@nhs.net for record keeping.
* A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. on the listserv for a listserv violation; GitHub for a GitHub violation, etc.).
  The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
* An imposed "time out" from online spaces.
  Zoë Turner and Chris Beeley will communicate this "time out" to the individual(s) involved.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all NHS-R Community project spaces (GitHub, in-person events etc).
  The research team will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or otherwise maintained.
  If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the Code of Conduct committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution.
The Code of Conduct committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.
However, the Code of Conduct committee is not required to act on this feedback.

## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest such that Zoë Turner is not able to evaluate or enforce the reported violation, Chris Beeley will take responsibility and in the event that both are involved in the conflict of interest this will be escalated to a senior manager within NHS Midland and Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit.
